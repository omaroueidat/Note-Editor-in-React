# Note-Editor-in-React
Building a Not Editor with React js framework

This Project was done during my React js Course on Scrimba (credits for scrimba for providing the source code that I added the features into it)

The Code of the editor itself was provided by scrimba, I added the features:
- Adding a new Note
- Sorting the note in a priority system for the last edited note
- Deleting a Note
- Saving the Note into firebase (was done like local storage but through firebase)
